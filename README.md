Python Snippets for Data Scientists

I have developed the following codes for Data Scientists in order to quickly dispatch codes and view analytics. Undoubtedly, deriving information and taking decisions is as valuable as developing algorithms. Consequently, spending the time to develop certain snippets that can be used to speed up the process, could provide teremendous value to the analytics phase of any data science project in the business and corporate world.

Those are some of the data models that are uploaded here
• Decision Tree Modelling
 ○ Decision Tree with Cart Decisions
 ○ Decision Tree with C5.0 Algorithms
 ○ Random Forest Algorithm
• K-Means Clustering
• Regression Analysis

More models will be added throughout time.
Please feel free to go through the codes, make remarks and report any issues.


Thank you
